			 * Bug fix.
			 * When you send HTML letters with embedded images, the images have absolute URL.
			 * But this is often not accepted by hostings (due to the settings of fopen).
			 * So convert absolute URL to file path.
			 * When attaching files, there is no such problem, since in this case files have not absolute URL
