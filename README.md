## About Blox CMS

Blox CMS is a system for website development, assembly and management, written in PHP.

The concept of the system is as abstract as possible. There are no headers, footers or sidebars. 
The number of system entities is minimal â€” "block" is the main term of the system.
Even there is no admin panel in its usual sense.

Due to block structure of the site, it is easy to use Ajax.

To start the creation of sites, you need to learn how to code templates, learn how to assign templates to the blocks and how to assemble pages with blocks. 
Despite the simplicity of Blox CMS, you can develop websites of any complexity, even online stores.
